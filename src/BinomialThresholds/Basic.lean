This answers (the order-of-growth side of) a question of Erdős on the small
prime factors of `C(n, k)` (erdosproblems.com/684).

# The objects (faithful to arXiv:2603.29961 §2)

`u n k = ∏_{p ≤ k, p prime} p ^ v_p( C(n,k) )` — the part of the binomial
coefficient `C(n,k)` supported on primes `≤ k`.

`f n = min { k : u n k > n² }`.

The paper proves, for `n` large,
  `f n ≤ (24/(π²−6) + o(1)) (log n)²  ≤ 6.20219 (log n)²`,
and that `f nⱼ ≥ (1/2 + o(1)) log nⱼ` for some `nⱼ → ∞`.

## Scope decision (the "finish completely, zero axioms" line)

The paper's *sharp* constants (`24/(π²−6)`, `1/2`) come from
`θ(x) ~ x` — the Prime Number Theorem asymptotic, which is NOT in mathlib
(that is exactly what the PrimeNumberTheorem+ project exists to supply).

We deliberately formalize the **constant-relaxed** statements:
  `f n = O((log n)²)`  and  `f n = Ω(log n)` infinitely often.
These need only the *elementary* Chebyshev bounds. mathlib v4.29.1 ships the
relevant *upper* bounds (`Chebyshev.theta_le_log4_mul_x`,
`Chebyshev.psi_le_const_mul_self`, `Chebyshev.abs_psi_sub_theta_le_sqrt_mul_log`)
but, as of this formalization, **no θ/ψ lower bound** — so the matching lower
bound `θ(2n) ≥ 2n·log2 − o(n)` is built from central binomials in
`BinomialThresholds.ChebyshevLower` (`theta_ge`). With that, the relaxed result
is provable unconditionally on plain mathlib v4.29.1.

Sharp constant `24/(π²−6)` would need PNT; this needs only Chebyshev. Proved in
`BinomialThresholds.Asymptotic` as `f_le_polylog` (it needs the full §2 machinery,
which imports this file). -/
